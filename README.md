## High Concept
The game depicts the plots of an actor who is within the concept of the "Survival" program. The player must be brave enough to find immunity statues as he obtains food and goes through grueling stages like a maze. There is also a two-dimensional scene where the player will have to collect food in order to win the game.

## Overview
The player begins on a lonely island where he has to hunt animals, and find immunity sculptures that will end up him moving on to the next stages. During the second stage - this is a washout scene where the player has to discover a secret room that will lead him to the last stage of the game - a 2D scene where the player will have to obtain food in order to win.

## Players Objectives
* To collect food.
* To collect immunity sculptures.
* To solve a maze phase.
* In the 2D Scene - to collect more food.

## Camera
In the main scene, the camera follows the main character, and if you choose to use the boat, the camera switches on top of the boat and follows the main character while sailing.
In the 2D scene there is another camera that also follows you.
